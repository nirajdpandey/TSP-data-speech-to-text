# TSP-data-speech-to-text
Extract TSP speech data annotation and model ASR system on it
***
TSP speech data is not ready to use for ASR systems as they do not have annotation attached to it. In order to extract annotation you can use the tool named `AFsp-v10r2`. This tool will extract hidded transcripts from the .wav files header. 
#### What is header in wav files?
Well, it's an information inbulit with the files while speech were recorded. To see any header information of a wav file type >>> `xxd | head CB01_01.wav` where head CB01_01.wav is the name of the target wav file, you want to see header of. This will generate following cmd output. 

`(base) niraj@Dell:~/Documents/work_place/TSP_Speech/TSP_48k/CB$` `xxd | head CB01_01.wav`

Here one can see that the annotation and other information are stored in the header which `AFsp-v10r2` will extract and our python script use that to make use of compiled C code to generate a pipe seperated csv file with all these information and many more.

Now our target is to find relevant information from this text and tranform it to a csv file for further processing.

Here are the steps involved: 

1. Download this repository
2. Unzip `AFsp-v10r2` into the home directory
3. Run >>> `make` (this will make C written InfoAudio and other tool accessible to you via command line)
4. Now run >>> python TSP_Speech.py
*** 
This will extract and use `AFsp-v10r2` tool to provide you a big .csv file with annotation and other speech features. They can be used for ASR or TTS modelling.
